#   PART 1: Degree based Centrality Measures
#######################################################################################

##  Degree Centrality (number of ties)
degree(g, mode="all") # by default, results are not normalized

degree(g, mode = "all", normalized = TRUE) # To get normalized results, set normalized = TRUE

degree(dg, mode = "in")
##  Eigenvector Centrality (centrality proportional to the sum of connection centralities)
##  Values of the first eigenvector of the graph matrix.
##  Returns unit length vector, if scale is not set TRUE
?eigen_centrality
eigen_centrality(g, directed=F, weights=NA)$vector #undirected graph
eigen_centrality(dg, directed=T, weights=NA)$vector #directed, acyclic graph

#   PART 2: Flow based Centrality Measures
#######################################################################################

## Eccentricity Centrality(The less eccentric a node is, the more central it is.)
ec<- 1/eccentricity(g)
ec


##  Closeness Centrality (centrality based on distance to others in the graph)
##  Inverse of the nodeâ€™s average geodesic distance to others in the network.
closeness(g, mode="all", weights=NA)

closeness(g, mode="all", weights=NA, normalized = TRUE)


##  Betweenness Centrality (centrality based on a broker position connecting others)
##  Number of geodesics that pass through the node or the edge.
betweenness(g, directed=F, weights=NA) # computes node betweenness for each node
betweenness(g, directed=F, weights=NA, normalized = TRUE)

edge_betweenness(g, directed=F, weights=NA) # computes edge betweenness for each edge

page_rank(g, algo = "arpack") # options is returned if "arpack" algo is used for PageRank computation
